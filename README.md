Essential tremor is a medical condititon in which a patients hand shakes repeatedly. It could happen in old age people, people with anxiety, distress, or who have met accident and is unable to keep thieir hands still. This make the action of eating difficult i.e., while eating, due to shaking of hands, it make them unable to hold food in their spoon. Therefore , we are developing a spoon which can alter the hand movements of the patients hands, thus making the spoon's bowl stable. This helps in stablizing the movements and hence the patient can eat easily. After researching about the problem, we found that there could be various cases to use this type of device for example for old age people, new borns to make them eat on their own. The spoon uses electromagnets which levitate the neck and bowl portion and alter the movement of the spoon. Use of electromagnet make the spoon energy efficient and light-weight too.
